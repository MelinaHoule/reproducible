\usage{
cloudDownload(
  outputHash,
  newFileName,
  gdriveLs,
  cacheRepo,
  cloudFolderID,
  drv = getOption("reproducible.drv", RSQLite::SQLite()),
  conn = getOption("reproducible.conn", NULL)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{outputHash}{The \code{cacheId} of the object to upload}

\item{newFileName}{The character string of the local filename that the downloaded object will have}

\item{gdriveLs}{The result of \code{googledrive::drive_ls(as_id(cloudFolderID), pattern = "outputHash")}}

\item{cacheRepo}{A repository used for storing cached objects.
This is optional if \code{Cache} is used inside a SpaDES module.}

\item{cloudFolderID}{A googledrive id of a folder, e.g., using \code{drive_mkdir()}.
If left as \code{NULL}, the function will create a cloud folder with a warning.
The warning will have the \code{cloudFolderID} that should be used in subsequent calls.
It will also be added to \code{options("reproducible.cloudFolderID")},
but this will not persist across sessions.}

\item{drv}{an object that inherits from \linkS4class{DBIDriver},
or an existing \linkS4class{DBIConnection}
object (in order to clone an existing connection).}

\item{conn}{A \linkS4class{DBIConnection} object, as returned by
\code{\link[DBI:dbConnect]{dbConnect()}}.}
}
\description{
Meant for internal use, as there are internal objects as arguments.
